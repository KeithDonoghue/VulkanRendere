1)
	Curretnly all the work is done in WndProc which calls into Swapchain update, where all teh work is done.
	Swapchain update should only get the next presentabl and optionally finalize it. all the rendering work should 
	be done in a different thread.

2)	The Swaphain and que present semaphores need to be used correctly this needs mre than jsut two semaphires
	but some sort of round robin or pool.

3)	Delete objects queue. We ahve to wait for teh gpu to be done with it before we delete therefore this 
	requiers waiting on a queue or an event, dont do this on the work thread. If we are done with it we can move on.

4)	Memory Management.
